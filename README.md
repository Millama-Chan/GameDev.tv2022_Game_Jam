# GameDev.tv2022_Game_Jam
My source code from the game I made for the Jam

1. I don't have much experience with Github

2. If you find any bugs or problems on the way I attached the source of my game PLEASE notify me. I'll try my best to solve the issue 
(Maybe if you could assist or give me information on how to fix the problem you found while also notifying me that would be realy appreciated)

Thanks for checking my project and this future mess of a code out
:D
