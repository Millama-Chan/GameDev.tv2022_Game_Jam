# Hell's new strategist: a game for the GameDev.tv2022_Game_Jam

This is the source code from my game I made for the GameDev.tv2022_Game_Jam

Observations:

1. I don't have much experience with Github

2. If you find any bugs or problems on the way I attached the source of my game PLEASE notify me. I'll try my best to solve the issue 

3. This was my first full game

4. My laptop is very old and outdated. I have very limted resources and tried my best to make a simple fun strategy game

5. If you are a player that values graphics over gameplay, sorry but this is the best I can afford to do at the moment.

Thanks for checking my project and this possible mess of a code out
:D
